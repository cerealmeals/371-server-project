a)  A proxy server needs to be able to receive HTTP requests and redirect them 
    to the correct destination get the response from the correct server and 
    return that response to the original client.

    Do Katie do we need to implement web caching? It is talked about in the slides in the section she has mentioned

b)  



c)  We initially created the server single threaded and then implement multi-threaded.
    But quickly changed it beacuse the server needs to be able to respond to multiple clients at a time.
    When you accept a connecting you make a thread to handle the connection when that specific connection ends
    you close the connection and the thread.
    Being multithreaded alows for better performance because at some points your server might be waiting for the client,
    during that time it can service other clients but only if it is multithreaded. It also allows the server to be almost
    continuouly accepting new connections from clients. Our server has a max backlog of clients to be connected of 5.
